[Interstellar Penguins UE4 Game](https://github.com/inspiredtolive/Interstellar_Penguin)
Interstellar Penguins is a 3D adventure game that aside from map assets, was created from the ground up in Unreal Engine 
4 by my partner Marco and myself. We developed the character assets, then basic player and game interactions, and finally
the NPC Shark and Fish AI's that have dynamic behaviours based on player actions. Noteably, the individual fish in the
schoolsmove according to a custom schooling algorithm which allows them to move as a group without colliding into 
eachother.
